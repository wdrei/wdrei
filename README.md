- 👋 Hi, I’m Andreas Kummeer a.k.a. @wdrei
- 👀 I'm interested in a lot of things, but as a developer my focus is Python, ideally using Django and in the area of web-contrernt using Wagtail.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... What do you want me to say? Every day something is added that will hopefully prove useful at some point.
